## Basic Workflow for Task Manager

1. **Task Dashboard and List**  
   The dashboard allows you to create, view, sort, and search tasks, as well as navigating to next page. You can sort by **Created Date** or **Due Date**, and search tasks by name.

2. **Creating a New Task**  
   To create a new task, click **Create New Task**. Fill in the task name, description, and due date. The new task will appear in the top of task list by default.

3. **Editing a Task**
   To edit the newly created task, click the **Edit** button within the task item. You can modify the task name, description, and due date.

4. **Task Status**  
   The edited task will have the status being updated based on the new due date.
